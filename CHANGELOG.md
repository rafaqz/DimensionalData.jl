## [0.30.0]

### Added

- `combine` method added to complement `groupby` ([#903])
- `DimSlices` object is now documented interface.
- Tables can now be converted to `AbstractDimArray` or `AbstractDimStack`,
  guessing the lookup values from dimension columns, thanks to major efforts by [@JoshuaBillson] and [@tiemvanderdeure] in ([#739])
- `presevedims` can be used to preseve dimensions of array during conversion to
  tables, so that values may themselves be `AbstractDimArray` ([#917])
- `rebuildsliced` documented and added to the developer interface 
- Broadcasts improved for all `AbstractBasicDimArray`, like `DimSelectors`.

### Fixed

- `Begin`/`End` bugfixed for use as types

### Changed

- `similar` for `AbstractDimStack` has modified behavior more consistent with
  `similar` for `AbstractArray` ([#903]).
- Internal const `CategoricalEltypes` now includes `DataType` - sot that a
  lookup of types is considered `Categorical` by default ([#876]).
- `skipmissing` on an `AbstractDimStack` now skips any `missing` values in any fiels, rather than `missing`, which can't
  actually occur ([#1041]).
- Minor changes in coversion to and from tables in some cases.
